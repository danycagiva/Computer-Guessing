# Computer-Guessing
A Simple Game for Randomized Number Guessings written in Python 
## Goals of the Script
Create a simple stochastic Variant to guess the next number. This could be further used to create 
stochastic autocomplete. 
The File daten.txt is meant to be a dataset und should not be tampered with. It takes all inputs 
throughout the rounds and appends them at the end. 

## Next Steps
Right now i didnt implement any ML functions. But this could be used to recreate the simple steps to creating 
a simple ML Algorithm that guesses your next input based on probability. 
So the next big feature should be the creation of an Algorithm that calculates the probability of the most probable 
numbers inside the Dataset and creates a new range within these.
